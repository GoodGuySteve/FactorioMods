This is just a simple fix to the pyanodon mods to manually remove high-frequency sounds from the mod sounds. These 
sounds trigger migraines for me, so it's mostly just for my personal use.

I don't claim any ownership of the sound files, nor do I make any guarantee that they haven't diminished from their
original sound quality.
